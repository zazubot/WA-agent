What happens when [two ML Engineers](#contributors) with a love for sci-fi movies team up? 🤔

> You can think of it as a modern reinterpretation of the Turing Test 🤣

By the end of this course, you'll have built your own Zazu too, capable of:

- Receiving and sending Whatsapp messages 📲
- Understanding your voice 🗣️
- Recognizing your images 🖼️
- Sending voice notes back 🎤
- Sharing updates about its "daily activities" 🚣
- Sending you images of its current activities 🖼️

Excited? Let's get started!
